## Grokking_experiences
In this repo, we reproduce some experiments about grokking phenomenon. We reproduce the experiment of training a toy model transformer model to exhibit the grokking phenomenon, and to tune the hyperparameters to enlight some properties

# Schrodinger PCA

### The hierarchy of files and their uses:

* gaussian/laplace
  * fig: finetuning folder, all the code needed to do fine-tuning
  * Mod_add: code to reproduce the experiment on a 2-layer transformers network, to see grokking on the problem of modular additio 
  * Parking: code to reproduce the experiment on a 2-layer transformers network, to see grokking on the problem of parking



### Dependency (python package)
*all dependencies are in requirements.txt
